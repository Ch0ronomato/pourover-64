# A tribute to coffee

Making a pour over means a lot of things. Generally it means
1. Grind
2. Pick filter
3. Wet / warm things
4. Place grinds
5. Bloom
6. Pour / flow rate


I think these choices would be fun as a game. Especially if at the end
you could have a score of how good your coffee was based on extraction science.
